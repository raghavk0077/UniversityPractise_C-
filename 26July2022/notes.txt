User defined datatype
exp -- if you want to collect data of students you can create your own datatype using struct
==>
struct Student {
    int age, uid;
    string name;
} s1;
s1 ==> it is object created for student to use in the program
exp -- s1.name = "Raghav";

Another way of declaring an object for struct
struct Student s2;

int main() {
    struct Student s2;
    cin>>s1.age>>s1.uid;
    getline(cin,s1.name);
    cin>>s2.age>>s2.uid;
    getline(cin,s2.name);

}
